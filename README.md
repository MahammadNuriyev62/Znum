# Znum

Znum is new Python data type, exists as a fully functional number available for any mathematical operation. Z-number of Znum can be added, subtracted, multiplied, divided by the another Znum or natural number. It can also be sorted, compared, and raised to the power. Znum is not only a data type, but also a tool to solve optimization problems using Topsis, Vikor and Promethee optimization methods.

```python
from znum.Znum import Znum

z1 = Znum([1,2,3,4], [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4])
z2 = Znum([2,4,8,10], [0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8])

z3 = z1 + z2

print(z3)
```

So simple
